 bot for Telegram that interacts with the Brawl Stars API. The bot can find a player's rank in the top for a specific tag in all regions, and it can also find the player's rank in all regions for a specific brawler. The autodatabaseupdating function is a loop that runs every 2 hours to refresh the database. The startBot function is the handler for the /start command. If the database is being updated, it sends a message to the user with the progress. If not, it sends a welcome message and two buttons to the user: one for searching for a player's rank in the top and one for finding the player's rank in all regions.
